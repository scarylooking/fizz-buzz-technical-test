# Technical Challenge
You have 15 minutes to complete the following challenges, or to get as far as you can.

## Clone the Solution
Clone the solution from https://github.com/scarylooking/fizz-buzz-technical-test.git

## Implement the **IFizzBuzz** interface
Modify the *FizzBuzz* skeleton class so that it satisfies the interface defined by *IFizzBuzz*

## Implement the **FizzBuzz** class
Implement the *TestValue* method of the *FizzBuzz* class so that it returns…

+	“fizz” when a multiple of three is passed in
+	“buzz” when a multiple of five is passed in.

## Complete **Program.Main**
Implement the rest of *Program.Main* so that it takes a single integer between **1** and **100** as input and returns a result from the *FizzBuzz* class.

Add any error checking you think is appropriate.

## Complete the Unit Tests
Add the *fizz-buzz-test* project to the solution and make all 3 unit tests it contains pass.

Implement additional tests and edge case checking. What happens when you enter 15?
